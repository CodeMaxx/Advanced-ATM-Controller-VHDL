ERROR:Place:1108 - A clock IOB / BUFGMUX clock component pair have been found
   that are not placed at an optimal clock IOB / BUFGMUX site pair. The clock
   IOB component <mii_tx_clk_i> is placed at site <K16>. The corresponding BUFG
   component
   <ethernet_with_mac/ethernet_inst/mii_gmii_io_inst/clock_tx_BUFGMUX_inst> is
   placed at site <BUFGMUX_X3Y8>. There is only a select set of IOBs that can
   use the fast path to the Clocker buffer, and they are not being used. You may
   want to analyze why this problem exists and correct it. If this sub optimal
   condition is acceptable for this design, you may use the
   CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint in the .ucf file to demote this message to a
   WARNING and allow your design to continue. However, the use of this override
   is highly discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing results. It is
   recommended that this error condition be corrected in the design. A list of
   all the COMP.PINs used in this clock placement rule is listed below. These
   examples can be used directly in the .ucf file to override this clock rule.
